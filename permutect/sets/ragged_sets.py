class RaggedSets:
    """
    Class for batch of ragged sets.  Sets in the batch can have different sizes; elements are vectors of fixed dimension.

    Conceptually the data are an array X_bsf, where b indexes the set within the batch, s indexes the element within a set,
    and f is the feature index.  b ranges from 0 to B-1, f from 0 to F-1, but the range of s is different for each b.

    Because Pytorch's support for ragged tensors (the nested package) is incomplete and not yet stable, this is my own implementation.

    The data in this class are stored as i) partially-flattened tensor X_nf, where n indexes both b and s in the natural order,
    and ii) an LongTensor of set bounds, which should start at 0, end at N, and have size B+1.

    The bth set starts with the bounds[b]-th flattened element (inclusive) and ends with the bounds[b+1]-th flattened element
    (exclusive).  bounds must be in non-decreasing order.

    Example: sets of sizes 1,3,2; bounds = [0, 1, 4, 6]
